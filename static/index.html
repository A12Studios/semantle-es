    <h3>Guess the word</h3>
    <p>
      Each guess must be a word (of any length).  The similarity value
      is how similar word2vec thinks your word is to the secret word.
      The highest possible similarity is 100 (indicating that the
      words are identical and you have won).  You will need more than
      six guesses.  You will probably need dozens of guesses.
      <b>There's a new word every day</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Words may be any part of speech.  It's tempting to think only of
      nouns, since that is how normal semantic word-guessing games
      work.  Don't get caught in the trap!  Since our Word2Vec data
      set contains some proper nouns, guesses are case-sensitive.  But
      I removed all but lower-case words from the secret word set, and
      if your word matches the secret word but for case, you win
      anyway.  So if you want to know if the word is more like nice
      or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice">Nice</a>, you
      can ask about both.

      <a href="http://www.topped-with-meat.com/connector/frenchtoast.html">Prior
      art</a>. I discovered French Toast about 20 years ago, and
      immediately knew that I had to
      tell <a href="https://blog.plover.com/">Dominus</a> about it.
      He replied that in fact he
      and <a href="https://moonmilk.com/">Ranjit</a> had invented it
      ten or so years before that, and called it "Plenty Questions".</p>
<p>
      But I wasn't thinking of French Toast when I invented this.
      Instead, I was thinking
      about <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a>
      and <a href="https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/">Worldle</a> and about
      the dimensionality of data sets.  I considered Filmle, a movie
      guessing game: You say "The Matrix", it says "Keanu Reeves has a
      bacon number of 3 where bacon is the lead actor in the target
      film." (and so on for Carrie-Ann Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and
      Hugo Weaving for actors at corresponding billings).  But I don't
      care about movies.  Too bad,
      because <a href="https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/">IMDB</a>
      actually has exactly the data that you would need to implement
      it in a really easy form.  Then I remembered word2vec, and here
      we are.
